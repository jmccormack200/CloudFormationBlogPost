# PickPocket Backend - Winter 2017

## Overview of Project:

The project is structured as a series of AWS Lambda functions with a DynamoDB database to store information. The lambda functions can be deployed using AWS API Gateway to allow for the remote access of the endpoints. Initially, this was done in a very manual process. There is now a set of scripts built around Amazon Cloud Formation to allow for a quick deployment of the system to any AWS account.

Currently the database and SNS integration still need to be configured manually.

* [Deploying](#deploying) - The functions can be copy and pasted manually to aws or the shell script can handle their generation automatically.
* [Functions](#functions) - Create a UI that allows you to play a one-way Mastermind game against a computer opponent.
* [Previous Guesses](#previous-guesses) - Add a list of previous guesses to the UI to make it easier to remember what youâ€™ve already guessed.
* [Networking](#networking) - Add a networking class that allows you to crack a remote lock using an API.

## Deploying

To deploy automatically, first configure the functions in `config.json` similar to below:

```Javascript
{
  "functions" : [
    {
      "function":"FetchUsers.py",
      "api_path":"users",
      "method":"GET"
    },
    {
      "function":"CreateUserBasic.py",
      "api_path":"users",
      "method":"POST"
    },
    {
      "function":"PickLockUrl.py",
      "api_path":"pick/{victim}",
      "method":"POST"
    }
  ]
}
```

Where:
* `function` is the name of the python file
* `api_path` is the route that will be used in the api gateway
* `method` is the type of request the lambda function will correspond to (ex: GET, POST)

Once that is done call `deploy.sh` with the name you would like to use for the stack:

```Bash
  ./deploy.sh STACKNAME
```

Checkout this [link](https://docs.google.com/a/intrepid.io/document/d/1Wywului461Y45yPI0grVbXJd6oj6FukvSLCbRmFJaLw/edit?usp=sharing
), which describes the game logic in more detail.

These models are included in the starter project. Start by implementing the `submitGuess` function.
```Java
public class Lock {
    public Result submitGuess(String guess) {
        return null;
    }
}

public class Result {
    int numCorrect;
    int numMisplaced;
}
```

A completed `Lock` should be initialized with a code (you'll have to write this part). You can then get a `Result` back by submitting a guess `String`. The `Result` will contain hints for the correct and misplaced digits as per the rules.

Write unit tests that verify that the game logic is working correctly, and you'll be all set with this part!

## Functions

Below is a quick overview of the different lambda functions in this repository, for more information please refer to the individual files:

* `FetchUsers` - Returns a list of the userIDs of every person in the database along with the length of their combination.
* `CreateUserBasic` - Supply a userId, DisplayName, and Combination, returns an error if username taken, otherwise returns success and a token.
* `PickPocketUrl` - Provide a UserId to pick, the token of the current user, and a combination guess to attempt to pick the lock of another user.
* `UpdateDisplayName` - Allows a user to change their display name. UserId cannot be changed.
* `EditCombination` - Provide a token and new combination to change the lock associated with that user.
* `PickPocket` This is a deprecated function and should not be used anymore. It does not require the token to pick a user.

** Quirks **
When you first run the deployment script you may receive an error that there is no file `deploy.json`. This is due to a quick hack that first deletes the existing file if its there before running `concat_files.py.` It will hopefully be fixed in future updates.
